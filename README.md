# Spontaneous

We created a responsive full-stack application that allows users to sign up for a Spontaneous account and select interests. We were able to query meetups api based on interests from various categories. We were able to display three random activities for the user and they can comment on each activity they’ve attended.

## User Stories

As a  user who has just moved to an area, I want to find meet-ups in my area. 
As a user who has been in the area for a while, I want to find new things to do in my area.
As a user, I want to try something new. 
As a user, I want to meet new people. 

## Step by step user paths

1. A user visits spontaneous.com (URL in progress)
2. If a user has an existing account; 
  1. The user will sign in 
3. If the user does not have an existing account:
  1. The user will sign up for an account providing:
  2. Email 
  3. Username
  4. Password
4. Once the user signs up, they will be brought to a screen that allows them to customize their profile by selecting their interests for Meetup’s they would be curious to attend.
5. On the landing page, the user will be shown three potential Meetup’s generated from their interests selected in step 3. 
6. Users can add one of the three Meetups to their “Saved” column and comment anonymously on a Meetup after they’ve attended.
